    {\bf Director/Consultant} \>The Build Doctor Limited     \>Jan. 2010-Present
   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}      % suppress blank line after tabbing
   The Build Doctor is my alter ego. He and I help teams deliver software into production. My
experience working in development and operations teams allows me to guide teams on the best way
to build and release the software that they write. I often work on Continuous Integration, Build
Tools and delivery of test infrastructure.
     %It feels good to help people.

    {\bf Production Manager} \>Enrich Social Productions     \>Jan. 2009-March 2010

   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}      % suppress blank line after tabbing
    I was in charge of all production systems including vendor management and Systems Administration.  Scaling didn't turn out to be a problem at this organisation.  So I was doing build and release management (including Continuous Integration) for our Ruby applications, generating Management Information using Quantrix, and helping with things like Search Engine Optimisation and blogging strategies. I used the excellent Puppet systems administration language to build our new systems. 
     %You have to be flexible in a startup.

     {\bf Build and Release Manager} \>Beazley Furlonge     \>Feb. 2008-Dec. 2008\\ 
                          \>London, UK
   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}

Reporting to the software architect, I took code from development and made sure that it was deployable and met our standards before deploying to test environments and making the right configurations available to the Systems Administration team.  I also managed the Continuous Integration service and the release scripts.  I learned that developers must be held responsible for the lifecycle of the code that they write, and that you can't inspect in quality.
    %You could tell that this wasn't my thing. Huge culture shock.

    {\bf Infrastructure Specialist} \>ThoughtWorks \> April. 04-Feb. 08\\
                          \>London, UK
   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}
	Worked on projects at Dixons, Fidelity, AOL, BGI, Barclays, Dresner Klienwort, and Guardian News and Media.
	
     My role at ThoughtWorks was broadly to enhance the development effort by providing the CruiseControl Continuous Integration infrastructure, release scripts and process, and project systems administration support.

	Drawing on my systems administration expertise I spent four years taking software from a ``code complete'' state to production.  My experience supporting software and systems has allowed me to contribute real value to the software development process and I have been instrumental at and before go-live on many ThoughtWorks projects.
    %Sometimes amazing, sometimes horrid.  I learned so much.  I miss
    % some of my erstwhile colleagues every day.

	                          \>London, UK
	   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}
	This role was a great learning experience.  I started it with the feeling that I could get my head around this Java business, and by then end had done some Java programming, managing application servers and web infrastructure, a lot of Systems Administration automation, and a good deal of open source.

	                          \>London, UK
	\end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}
	I was a hired-gun sysadmin here.  Taught me that the traditional approach of throwing vendors at problems wasn't ever going to work.  I'd install something, a vendor would break it.  I'd fix it and break another vendor's product.  Was fun though.
	% I'm not big on cars any more, but I did like the company Audi Quattro.
	% Exodus was a big .com failure. Shame for the team.

	\end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}
	
	Very odd startup.  I knew enough then to think that things were wrong, but I couldn't say why.
	% The answer, of course was Puppet.  But Luke hadn't thought of that.
	% We should have been using cfengine

	\end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}
	Team leader to 4 Administrators and one DBA. Responsible for building and supported production and development equipment for Two Way TV's Interactive Television services.  I ended up sticking my oar into the way the network was designed as well.
	% The team was great.  I kinda rebelled against the management.

	\end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}
	
	This was my first job in the UK.  I travelled around the country doing outsourced service work for Sun, and learning more about Unix admin.  Was good clean fun.
	% Funnily enough, I ended up working with the same guys at Exodus.

	 The role involved maintenance of DNS servers and over 2000 customer domain names, general Solaris administration, and troubleshooting, integration and 3rd level technical support. Supported web hosting, mail, VPN DNS business systems and services. It was my first Unix Admin role and I worked my way up from helpdesk.
	% Special times.

	\end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}
	I partnered with local ISPs, content developers and computer consultants to gain work. Working on dial-up and dedicated systems, the work ranged from basic troubleshooting to participating in large commercial projects (setting up office email systems, networking).
	% cut my teeth on TCP/IP here.

\section{OTHER}          
    I presented at UKUUG 2007, Agile 2007, XP Day 2007, QCON London 2009, and every CITCON Europe that has ever taken place.  I love Open Source and started a project called Buildix while at ThoughtWorks.  I write extensively about taking code from desktop to delivery at my blog, The Build Doctor.  Next I want to explore the possibilities of Agile and Systems Administration.
 
    %There's so much left to do.

\section{SKILLS AND PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES}          
    Java, Ruby, Unix Systems Administration, Puppet, XP/Agile, Continuous Integration, Delivering Working Software.
    %There's so many skills I could list here.  Including the ones in the attic, like Sendmail and RS-232.

\section{JUST FOR FUN}          
    Dad to two daughters and cycle with them when we can. I love to cook Indian food and taste good wine.
    %I'm a bit light on having a life kind of things, I know.
