    {\bf Production Manager} \>Enrich Social Productions     \>Jan. 2009-Present

   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}      % suppress blank line after tabbing
    I manage all our development and systems - some entirely, some via vendors.  We haven't needed to do much infrastructure build-out yet.    So I've been doing build and release management (including Continuous Integration in Hudson) for our Ruby applications, generating MI using Quantrix, and helping with things like Search Engine Optimisation and blogging strategies. I am using the excellent Puppet systems administration language to build the systems that I entirely manage.
     %You have to be flexible in a startup.

     {\bf Build and Release Manager} \>Beazley Furlonge     \>Feb. 2008-Dec. 2008\\ 
                          \>London, UK
   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}

Reporting to the software architect, I took code from development and made sure that it was deployable and met our standards before deploying to test environments and making the right configurations available to the Systems Administration team.  I also managed the Continuous Integration service and the release scripts.  I sat on the Change Control board and tried to ensure that an appropriate process was followed for changes.  I learned that developers must be held responsible for the lifecycle of the code that they write, and that you can't inspect in quality.
    %You could tell that this wasn't my thing. Huge culture shock.

    {\bf Infrastructure Specialist} \>ThoughtWorks \> April. 04-Feb. 08\\
                          \>London, UK
   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}
	Worked on projects at Dixons Stores Group, AOL, Fidelity Investments,  Barclays Global Investments, Barclays Business, Dresner Kleinwort, and Guardian News and Media.
	
     I made the developers more effective on ThoughtWorks projects by implementing the Continuous Integration (mainly using one of the CruiseControl tools) infrastructure, build tools (generally Apache Ant), release process and scripts, and project systems administration support.  A big part of the role was trying to bring siloed administration teams together to assist on development projects.

	My systems administration expertise helped me spent four years taking software from a ``code complete'' state to production.  My experience supporting software and systems has allowed me to contribute to the software development process and I have been instrumental at and before go-live on many ThoughtWorks projects.
    %Sometimes amazing, sometimes horrid.  I learned so much.  I miss
    % working with some of my ex-colleagues every day.

	   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}
	This role was a great learning experience.  When I started it I was confident that I could manage a system with a Java application server.  By then end I had done some Java programming, managing application servers (mainly WebLogic) and web infrastructure(iPlanet and Apache), a lot of Systems Administration automation (using CfEngine), and a good deal of open source.  I was also deputy Oracle DBA, and would do releases when our DBA was on holiday.

	\end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}
	I was a hired-gun Solaris sysadmin here.  Taught me that the traditional approach of throwing vendors at problems wasn't ever going to work.  I'd install something, a vendor would break it.  I'd fix it and break another vendor's product.
	% I'm not big on cars any more, but I did like the company Audi Quattro.
	% Exodus was a big .com failure. Shame for the team.

	.COM startup.  I knew enough then to think that things were wrong, but I couldn't say why.
	% The answer, of course was Puppet.  But Luke hadn't thought of that.

	\end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}
	Team leader to 4 Administrators and one DBA. Responsible for building and supporting production and development equipment for Two Way TV's Interactive Television services.  All Solaris and Oracle with the then bleeding edge Apache Jserve. I taught myself Jumpstart there. 
	% The team was great.  I kinda rebelled against the management.

	\end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}
	
	This was my first job in the UK.  I travelled around the country doing outsourced service work for Sun, and learning more about Unix adminstration.  Good, clean fun.
	% Funnily enough, I ended up working with the same guys at Exodus.

	 The role involved maintenance of DNS servers and over 2000 customer domain names, general Solaris administration, and troubleshooting, integration and 3rd level technical support. Supported web hosting, mail, VPN DNS business systems and services. It was my first Unix Admin role - I worked my way up from helpdesk.
	% Special times.  I spent a lot of evenings wrestling Perl.

	\end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}
	I partnered with local ISPs, content developers and computer consultants to gain work. Working on dial-up and dedicated systems, the work ranged from basic troubleshooting to participating in large commercial projects (setting up office email systems, networking).
	% cut my teeth on TCP/IP here.

	Electronics and computer technical support, telephone sales.
	% I learned to use a fax here.  And DOS.

	   
\section{OTHER}          
    I presented at UKUUG 2007, Agile 2007, XP Day 2007, QCON London 2009, and done informal talks at the London Ruby User's group.  Every year I attend CITCON Europe to discuss the world of Continuous Integration.  I love Open Source, and started a project called Buildix while at ThoughtWorks.  I have also made contributions to CriuseControl and Apache Ant.  I write extensively about taking code from desktop to production at my blog, The Build Doctor.  Presently, I'm very interested in the possibilities of Agile and Systems Administration.  I just attended the inaugural Devopsdays conference in Ghent, which was fantastic.
 
    %There's so much left to do.

\section{SKILLS AND PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES}          
    Ant, Java, Ruby, Perl, Shell scripts, Unix and Windows Systems Administration, Puppet, XP/Scrum/Agile, Continuous Integration, Delivering Working Software.
    %There's so many skills I could list here.  Including the ones in the attic, like Sendmail and RS-232.

\section{JUST FOR FUN}          
    I'm Dad to my two daughters and love to cycle with them when we can. I like to cook Indian food and taste good wine.  I'm also a fair-weather gardener.

    %I'm a bit light on having a life kind of things, I know.
